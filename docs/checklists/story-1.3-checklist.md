- [x] **Low Risk:** Theme persistence fixes

### Risk Mitigation
- [x] Focus on performance first as it affects user experience significantly
- [x] Consider implementing React.lazy for code splitting
- [x] Test with large datasets to ensure scalability
- [x] Monitor bundle size and loading times

## âœ… Dependencies Validation

### Required Dependencies
- [x] Story 1.2 (Dashboard UX/UI Improvements) - referenced
- [x] Material-UI optimization knowledge - implied
- [x] Performance profiling tools - mentioned

### Missing Dependencies
- [ ] **Flag icons library** - need to specify (react-country-flag or similar)
- [ ] **Virtual scrolling library** - need to specify (react-window or react-virtualized)
- [ ] **Internationalization library** - need to specify (react-i18next or similar)

## âœ… Estimation Validation

### Time Estimates
- [x] **Development:** 3-4 days (appropriate for scope)
- [x] **Testing:** 1 day (reasonable)
- [x] **Total:** 4-5 days (realistic)

### Story Points
- [x] **8 points** - appropriate for high complexity and multiple features

## âœ… User Feedback Integration

### Critical Issues Addressed
- [x] Theme persistence and consistency issues
- [x] Default display mode preference (List over Grid)
- [x] Pagination improvements (45 items, navigation buttons)
- [x] Language support with flag icons
- [x] List mode enhancements (full hex keys, wallet details)
- [x] Performance optimization (INP < 100ms target)

## âœ… Technical Feasibility

### Performance Targets
