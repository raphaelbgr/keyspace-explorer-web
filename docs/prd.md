**Enhancement Description:**
Expand the Bitcoin-only Keyspace Explorer to support 7 additional cryptocurrencies (BCH, DASH, DOGE, ETH, LTC, XRP, ZEC) with simultaneous address generation, multi-currency balance checking, and enhanced UI to display all supported currencies with appropriate icons and organization.

**Impact Assessment:**
- ✅ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)
- ✅ Major Impact (architectural changes required)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Extend proven Bitcoin keyspace exploration patterns to multiple cryptocurrencies
- Maintain existing Bitcoin functionality while adding 7 new cryptocurrency support
- Implement address normalization for different cryptocurrency formats
- Leverage existing database architecture with new currency-specific tables
- Enhance UI to support multi-currency display with appropriate iconography
- Preserve all existing performance optimizations and user experience patterns

**Background Context:**
The Bitcoin Keyspace Explorer has proven successful in demonstrating cryptographic concepts and providing educational value. Users want to expand this educational tool to cover multiple popular cryptocurrencies, allowing for comprehensive understanding of different blockchain address generation methods. This enhancement leverages the proven technical foundation while expanding the educational and practical scope to multiple cryptocurrency ecosystems. The existing PostgreSQL schema already includes tables for additional currencies (wallets_bch, wallets_dash, wallets_doge, wallets_eth, wallets_ltc, wallets_xrp, wallets_zec), indicating this enhancement was anticipated in the original design.

## Requirements

**Note:** These requirements are based on my understanding of your existing Bitcoin Keyspace Explorer system and the proven patterns from your completed sprint. Please review carefully and confirm they align with your project's reality.

### Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The existing Bitcoin address generation functionality will be extended to simultaneously generate addresses for BCH, DASH, DOGE, ETH, LTC, XRP, and ZEC using the same private key, maintaining all current Bitcoin functionality without breaking changes.

**FR2:** Address generation will support compressed and uncompressed formats where applicable (BTC, BCH, DASH, DOGE, LTC, ZEC) while handling ETH (uncompressed only) and XRP (different system) appropriately.

**FR3:** The balance checking system will query appropriate database tables (wallets_bch, wallets_dash, wallets_doge, wallets_eth, wallets_ltc, wallets_xrp, wallets_zec) for each generated address while maintaining existing Bitcoin balance checking.

**FR4:** Address normalization will be implemented to remove prefixes before database queries (ETH: remove "0x", BCH: remove "bitcoincash:") while preserving display formatting.

**FR5:** The Grid View will display all cryptocurrency addresses in expandable cards with currency-specific icons and organized sections for each supported currency.

**FR6:** The Table View will display multi-currency information in expandable rows with clear currency identification and balance information.

**FR7:** The Address Details Modal will show all cryptocurrency addresses generated from a single private key with appropriate currency icons and balance information.

**FR8:** The API endpoints (/api/generate-page, /api/generate-random-page, /api/balances) will support multi-currency generation and balance checking while maintaining backward compatibility.

**FR9:** Local (client-side) generation will support all cryptocurrencies using appropriate cryptographic libraries while maintaining the existing local/server mode toggle.

**FR10:** Random key selection and navigation will work across all supported cryptocurrencies while maintaining existing scroll reliability and auto-expansion functionality.

### Non-Functional Requirements

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy:** Extend existing balance service to query multiple currency tables (wallets_bch, wallets_dash, wallets_doge, wallets_eth, wallets_ltc, wallets_xrp, wallets_zec) while maintaining current Bitcoin table queries and caching patterns.

**API Integration Strategy:** Enhance existing API endpoints to generate and return multi-currency address sets while preserving current response formats and adding new currency fields. Implement address normalization middleware for API processing.

**Frontend Integration Strategy:** Extend existing React components to handle multi-currency data structures while maintaining current component architecture, state management patterns, and performance optimizations.

**Testing Integration Strategy:** Extend existing Jest test suites to cover multi-currency scenarios while maintaining current test patterns and adding cryptocurrency-specific test cases.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach:** Follow existing service-oriented architecture with new cryptocurrency services alongside existing KeyGenerationService and BalanceService patterns.

**Naming Conventions:** Maintain existing TypeScript naming conventions with currency-specific prefixes (e.g., `generateBtcAddress`, `generateEthAddress`) following established patterns.

**Coding Standards:** Preserve existing ESLint and TypeScript configuration while extending type definitions for multi-currency data structures.

**Documentation Standards:** Follow existing JSDoc patterns and README structure while adding cryptocurrency-specific documentation sections.

### Deployment and Operations
