# Story 1.10: Fix Critical UI and Navigation Issues

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user of the Bitcoin Keyspace Explorer,
**I want** all navigation controls, scanner functionality, and page management to work correctly with proper BigInt handling and responsive UI,
**so that** I can efficiently explore the keyspace without encountering broken functionality or incorrect data display.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Scanner modal opens and functions correctly when clicked
2. Keys per page selector updates the list while maintaining position in keyspace
3. Quick jump navigation properly updates current page and displays correct data
4. Page number input field is wide enough to display full page numbers
5. Previous/Next page navigation works correctly with BigInt values
6. Last page functionality displays correct private keys (not stuck at 0)
7. All BigInt serialization issues are resolved in both API and frontend
8. Navigation maintains proper state across all interactions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 1.9, we learned:
- ECC library initialization is critical for Bitcoin address generation
- BigInt serialization issues exist in API responses
- Scanner functionality was implemented but may have integration issues

### Technical Requirements
- Must handle BigInt values properly in both API and frontend
- Navigation state must be consistent across all components
- Page calculations must account for keys per page changes
- UI components must be responsive and properly sized

### Critical Issues to Address
1. **Scanner Modal**: Likely import or state management issue
2. **Keys Per Page**: State management and page calculation logic
3. **Quick Jump**: Page generation and state update logic
4. **Page Number Input**: CSS/styling issue for width
5. **BigInt Navigation**: Serialization and state management
6. **Last Page**: Calculation and display logic

### File Locations
- `apps/web/src/app/components/ScannerModal.tsx` - Fix scanner functionality
- `apps/web/src/app/store/scannerStore.ts` - Debug scanner state
- `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` - Fix navigation logic
- `apps/web/src/app/components/FloatingNavigation.tsx` - Fix page number input
- `apps/web/src/app/api/generate-page/route.ts` - Fix BigInt serialization
- `apps/web/src/app/api/generate-random-page/route.ts` - Fix BigInt serialization
- `apps/web/src/lib/services/KeyGenerationService.ts` - Fix last page calculation

### BigInt Handling Requirements
- API responses must convert BigInt to string
- Frontend must handle string page numbers properly
- Navigation calculations must work with large numbers
- State management must preserve BigInt precision

### UI/UX Requirements
- Page number input must be wide enough for large numbers
- Navigation must be responsive and intuitive
- Error states must be handled gracefully
- Loading states must be clear and informative
