# Story 1.23: Multi-Currency Grid View Enhancement

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user viewing keys in grid mode,
**I want** to see all cryptocurrency addresses organized by currency with appropriate icons,
**so that** I can easily identify and review addresses for each supported cryptocurrency.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Task 1: Multi-Currency Card Display Foundation
- [x] Enhance LazyKeyCard component to display multi-currency address sections
- [x] Add cryptocurrency-specific icons for BTC, BCH, DASH, DOGE, ETH, LTC, XRP, ZEC
- [x] Organize addresses by currency in expandable sections within each card
- [x] Display balance information for each currency with appropriate formatting

### Task 2: Visual Design and Performance
- [x] Maintain existing card layout and responsive design principles
- [x] Add currency-specific balance chips and visual indicators
- [x] Ensure card expansion performance remains smooth with 8x address data
- [x] Implement proper accessibility labels for all new currency elements

### Task 3: Complete Cryptocurrency Visibility (ENHANCED)
- [x] Ensure ALL 8 supported cryptocurrencies (BTC, BCH, DASH, DOGE, ETH, LTC, XRP, ZEC) are visible in expanded card view with complete address listings
- [x] Implement "Show All Tokens" functionality in card expansion showing every generated cryptocurrency address
- [x] Add visual indicators when cards contain additional cryptocurrencies beyond the summary view

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing Bitcoin-only card functionality must remain unchanged
- IV2: Card expansion and scroll performance must not degrade
- IV3: All existing visual themes and styling must be preserved
- IV4: Verify ALL 8 cryptocurrencies are visible and accessible in expanded states
- IV5: Confirm complete address listings for every supported cryptocurrency
- IV6: Validate no cryptocurrency data is hidden or truncated in any expansion view

## Dev Notes

### Multi-Currency Card Architecture
```typescript
interface MultiCurrencyCardProps {
  keyData: {
    privateKey: string;
    addresses: CurrencyAddressMap;
    balances: MultiCurrencyBalances;
    fundedCurrencies: CryptoCurrency[];
  };
  showAllTokens?: boolean;
  expandedCurrencies?: Set<CryptoCurrency>;
}
```

### Currency Icon Configuration
```typescript
const CURRENCY_ICONS = {
  BTC: '‚Çø',
  BCH: 'üçä', 
  DASH: 'üîµ',
  DOGE: 'üêï',
  ETH: '‚ö™',
  LTC: 'ü•à',
  XRP: 'üåä',
  ZEC: 'üõ°Ô∏è'
};
```

### Complete Visibility Requirements
- **All 8 cryptocurrencies must be accessible** in expanded view
- **No cryptocurrency data should be hidden** behind additional navigation
- **Visual indicators required** when more currencies are available
- **"Show All Tokens" toggle** for comprehensive display
