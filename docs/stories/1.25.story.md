# Story 1.25: Multi-Currency Address Details Modal Enhancement

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** user viewing detailed address information,
**I want** to see all cryptocurrency addresses generated from a single private key,
**so that** I can review and copy addresses for all supported cryptocurrencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Task 1: Multi-Currency Modal Foundation
- [x] Enhance AddressModal to display multi-currency address tables
- [x] Add cryptocurrency icons and proper currency identification
- [x] Display balance information for each currency address
- [x] Implement currency-specific fund highlighting and indicators

### Task 2: Interaction and Accessibility
- [x] Add copy functionality for all cryptocurrency addresses
- [x] Maintain existing modal responsive design and accessibility
- [x] Add external blockchain explorer links for each cryptocurrency
- [x] Ensure modal loading performance with 8x address data

### Task 3: Complete Cryptocurrency Visibility (ENHANCED)
- [x] Display ALL 8 cryptocurrencies in organized modal sections with complete address listings
- [x] Ensure modal includes every address type for every supported cryptocurrency
- [x] Add cryptocurrency filtering/search within modal for large address datasets
- [x] Implement "Export All Addresses" functionality for complete multi-currency address export

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing Bitcoin address modal functionality must remain unchanged
- IV2: Modal loading and rendering performance must not degrade significantly
- IV3: All existing copy and interaction features must continue to work
- IV4: Verify ALL 8 cryptocurrencies are visible and accessible in expanded states
- IV5: Confirm complete address listings for every supported cryptocurrency
- IV6: Validate no cryptocurrency data is hidden or truncated in any expansion view

## Dev Notes

### Multi-Currency Modal Architecture
```typescript
interface MultiCurrencyAddressModalProps {
  open: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  keyNumber: number;
  keyData: {
    privateKey: string;
    addresses: CurrencyAddressMap;
    balances: MultiCurrencyBalances;
    fundedCurrencies: CryptoCurrency[];
  };
  showAllCurrencies?: boolean;
  searchFilter?: string;
}
```

### Currency Section Configuration
```typescript
const CURRENCY_SECTIONS = [
  {
    currency: 'BTC',
    name: 'Bitcoin',
    icon: '‚Çø',
    color: '#f7931a',
    explorerUrl: 'https://blockstream.info/address/',
    addressTypes: ['p2pkh_compressed', 'p2pkh_uncompressed', 'p2wpkh', 'p2sh_p2wpkh', 'p2tr']
  },
  {
    currency: 'BCH',
    name: 'Bitcoin Cash',
    icon: 'üçä',
    color: '#00d4aa',
    explorerUrl: 'https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/address/',
    addressTypes: ['cashaddr_compressed', 'cashaddr_uncompressed', 'legacy_compressed']
  },
  // ... all 8 currencies with complete configuration
];
```

### Complete Visibility Requirements
- **All 8 cryptocurrencies displayed** in organized modal sections
- **Every address type shown** for every supported cryptocurrency
- **No pagination or hidden sections** - complete data visibility
- **Search/filter functionality** for large address datasets
- **Export all addresses** functionality for comprehensive data access

### Modal Performance Optimization
- **Virtualized address lists** for cryptocurrencies with many address types
- **Lazy loading** of address details for better initial load performance
- **Efficient search indexing** for quick filtering across all cryptocurrencies
- **Optimized rendering** for smooth scrolling through large address lists

### Export Functionality Requirements
```typescript
interface ExportOptions {
  format: 'JSON' | 'CSV' | 'TXT';
  includeBalances: boolean;
  includeCurrencies: CryptoCurrency[];
  includePrivateKey: boolean;
}
```

### Blockchain Explorer Integration
- **Currency-specific explorer links** for each cryptocurrency
- **Proper address formatting** for each blockchain explorer
- **Error handling** for unsupported address types
- **Visual indicators** for successful explorer link generation
