# Story 1.20: Multi-Currency Balance Database Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system checking balances across multiple cryptocurrencies,
**I want** to query the appropriate database tables for each currency,
**so that** balance information is retrieved from the correct cryptocurrency-specific tables.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Extend BalanceService to query wallets_bch, wallets_dash, wallets_doge, wallets_eth, wallets_ltc, wallets_xrp, wallets_zec
2. Implement parallel database queries for multiple currencies
3. Maintain existing Bitcoin balance checking functionality unchanged
4. Add address normalization before database queries (ETH, BCH prefixes)
5. Implement proper error handling for individual currency query failures
6. Ensure total query time does not exceed 150% of current Bitcoin-only queries
7. Add comprehensive logging for multi-currency balance operations
8. Create database connection pooling optimization for multiple table queries

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing Bitcoin balance queries must maintain current performance
- IV2: Database connection limits must not be exceeded during multi-currency queries
- IV3: All existing balance caching mechanisms must continue to function

## Dev Notes

### Database Architecture
```sql
-- Currency-specific wallet tables
wallets_btc (address, private_key, balance, created_at)
wallets_bch (address, private_key, balance, created_at)
wallets_dash (address, private_key, balance, created_at)
wallets_doge (address, private_key, balance, created_at)
wallets_eth (address, private_key, balance, created_at)
wallets_ltc (address, private_key, balance, created_at)
wallets_xrp (address, private_key, balance, created_at)
wallets_zec (address, private_key, balance, created_at)

-- Enhanced balance cache
balance_cache (address, currency, balance, source, cached_at, expires_at)
```

### Multi-Currency Service Interface
```typescript
interface MultiCurrencyBalanceService {
  async getBalancesForAllCurrencies(
    addresses: string[]
  ): Promise<MultiCurrencyBalanceResult>;
  
  async getBalancesForCurrency(
    currency: CryptoCurrency,
    addresses: string[]
  ): Promise<BalanceResult[]>;
  
  async aggregateBalances(
    results: MultiCurrencyBalanceResult
  ): Promise<AggregatedBalance>;
}
```

### Address Normalization Rules
- **ETH**: Remove "0x" prefix → Store: "a1b2c3...", Query: WHERE address = 'a1b2c3...'
- **BCH**: Remove "bitcoincash:" → Store: "qr2k...", Query: WHERE address = 'qr2k...'
- **Others**: Direct storage and query without modification

### Performance Targets
- Multi-currency query time: Maximum 150% of Bitcoin-only queries
- Database connections: Efficient pooling to prevent connection limit issues
- Memory usage: Optimize for large result sets across 8 currencies
- Cache effectiveness: Maintain existing cache hit rates across currencies

### Connection Pooling Strategy
- Separate connection pools for read/write operations
- Dynamic scaling based on multi-currency query load
- Connection timeout handling for long-running queries
- Load balancing across database replicas if available
