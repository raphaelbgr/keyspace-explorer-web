# Story 1.24: Multi-Currency Table View Enhancement

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user viewing keys in table mode,
**I want** to see multi-currency balance information in expandable rows,
**so that** I can efficiently review cryptocurrency data in a compact format.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Task 1: Table Row Multi-Currency Foundation
- [x] Enhance UltraOptimizedDashboard table rows to display multi-currency data
- [x] Add currency-specific balance columns with appropriate icons
- [x] Implement expandable row sections showing detailed currency breakdowns
- [x] Display total balance aggregation across all supported currencies

### Task 2: Performance and Visual Design
- [x] Maintain existing table virtualization and performance characteristics
- [x] Add currency-specific fund indicators and highlighting
- [x] Ensure table responsiveness with additional currency columns
- [x] Implement proper sorting and filtering for multi-currency data

### Task 3: Complete Cryptocurrency Visibility (ENHANCED)
- [x] Ensure expanded table rows display ALL 8 cryptocurrencies with complete address breakdowns
- [x] Implement expandable sub-sections within rows for each cryptocurrency with full address visibility
- [x] Add "Expand All Currencies" toggle for comprehensive multi-currency data display

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing table performance and virtualization must be maintained
- IV2: Bitcoin-only table functionality must continue to work
- IV3: Memory usage for large datasets must not exceed 150% of current usage
- IV4: Verify ALL 8 cryptocurrencies are visible and accessible in expanded states
- IV5: Confirm complete address listings for every supported cryptocurrency
- IV6: Validate no cryptocurrency data is hidden or truncated in any expansion view

## Dev Notes

### Multi-Currency Table Architecture
```typescript
interface MultiCurrencyTableRow {
  keyData: KeyWithMultiCurrency;
  expandedCurrencies: Set<CryptoCurrency>;
  showAllCurrencies: boolean;
  onExpandCurrency: (currency: CryptoCurrency) => void;
  onToggleAllCurrencies: () => void;
}
```

### Currency Column Configuration
```typescript
const CURRENCY_COLUMNS = [
  { id: 'BTC', label: '₿ Bitcoin', icon: '₿', color: '#f7931a' },
  { id: 'BCH', label: '🍊 Bitcoin Cash', icon: '🍊', color: '#00d4aa' },
  { id: 'DASH', label: '🔵 Dash', icon: '🔵', color: '#1c75bc' },
  { id: 'DOGE', label: '🐕 Dogecoin', icon: '🐕', color: '#c2a633' },
  { id: 'ETH', label: '⚪ Ethereum', icon: '⚪', color: '#627eea' },
  { id: 'LTC', label: '🥈 Litecoin', icon: '🥈', color: '#bfbbbb' },
  { id: 'XRP', label: '🌊 Ripple', icon: '🌊', color: '#23292f' },
  { id: 'ZEC', label: '🛡️ Zcash', icon: '🛡️', color: '#f4b728' }
];
```

### Expandable Row Requirements
- **All 8 cryptocurrencies must be expandable** within table rows
- **Complete address breakdowns** for each currency in expanded state
- **"Expand All Currencies" toggle** for comprehensive view
- **Sub-sections for each cryptocurrency** with full address visibility
- **No truncation** of cryptocurrency data in any view state

### Performance Considerations
- **Virtual scrolling** must handle expanded multi-currency data efficiently
- **Memory optimization** for large datasets with 8x address information
- **Lazy loading** of expanded currency details when not visible
- **Smooth expansion animations** for enhanced user experience
