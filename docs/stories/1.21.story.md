# Story 1.21: Multi-Currency Balance API Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user checking balances for generated addresses,
**I want** the `/api/balances` endpoint to return balance information for all supported cryptocurrencies,
**so that** I can see funding status across all generated addresses.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Extend `/api/balances` endpoint to accept multi-currency address arrays
2. Return balance information grouped by currency with appropriate formatting
3. Maintain existing Bitcoin balance API response format for backward compatibility
4. Implement address normalization middleware for incoming requests
5. Add proper error handling for currency-specific balance lookup failures
6. Ensure API response time scales linearly with currency count (max 7x current time)
7. Add comprehensive error responses for invalid address formats
8. Update API documentation and examples for multi-currency usage

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing balance checking workflows must continue to function
- IV2: API error handling patterns must be consistent across all currencies
- IV3: Rate limiting and security measures must apply to all currency queries

## Dev Notes

### API Request Structure
```typescript
interface MultiCurrencyBalanceRequest {
  addresses: {
    BTC?: string[];
    BCH?: string[];
    DASH?: string[];
    DOGE?: string[];
    ETH?: string[];
    LTC?: string[];
    XRP?: string[];
    ZEC?: string[];
  };
  currencies?: CryptoCurrency[]; // Optional filter
  includeMetadata?: boolean;
  cacheResults?: boolean;
}
```

### API Response Structure
```typescript
interface MultiCurrencyBalanceResponse {
  success: boolean;
  balances: {
    [currency in CryptoCurrency]: {
      [address: string]: {
        balance: string;
        confirmed: string;
        unconfirmed: string;
        source: BalanceSource;
        lastUpdated: string;
      };
    };
  };
  metadata: {
    totalAddresses: number;
    currenciesChecked: CryptoCurrency[];
    responseTime: number;
    cacheHitRate: number;
  };
  errors?: {
    [currency in CryptoCurrency]?: {
      message: string;
      code: string;
      affectedAddresses: string[];
    };
  };
  summary: {
    totalValue: {
      [currency in CryptoCurrency]: string;
    };
    fundedAddresses: number;
    totalAddresses: number;
  };
}
```

### Address Normalization Middleware
```typescript
const normalizeAddresses = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  // ETH: Remove 0x prefix
  if (req.body.addresses.ETH) {
    req.body.addresses.ETH = req.body.addresses.ETH.map(addr => 
      addr.startsWith('0x') ? addr.slice(2) : addr
    );
  }
  
  // BCH: Remove bitcoincash: prefix
  if (req.body.addresses.BCH) {
    req.body.addresses.BCH = req.body.addresses.BCH.map(addr =>
      addr.startsWith('bitcoincash:') ? addr.slice(12) : addr
    );
  }
  
  next();
};
```

### Performance Targets
- Multi-currency response time: Maximum 7x Bitcoin-only time
- Response size optimization: Compression for payloads >1MB
- Cache effectiveness: Maintain >80% cache hit rate for repeated queries
- Error rate: <1% for well-formed multi-currency requests

### Rate Limiting Strategy
- Per-currency rate limits based on external API constraints
- Adaptive rate limiting based on response time patterns
- Priority queuing for cached vs. fresh balance requests
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing external APIs

### Currency-Specific Considerations
- **BTC**: Use existing Blockstream API integration patterns
- **ETH**: Handle Wei to ETH conversion and gas considerations
- **BCH**: Support both legacy and CashAddr formats
- **Others**: Implement placeholder external API patterns with graceful fallbacks
