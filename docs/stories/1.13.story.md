# Story 1.13: Convert Scanner from Modal to Expandable Card with Auto-Navigation

## Status
**Complete** ✅

## Story
**As a** user exploring the Bitcoin keyspace,
**I want** the scanner to be an expandable card instead of a modal with intelligent auto-navigation features,
**so that** I can seamlessly scan through the keyspace while maintaining context of the main interface and have automated navigation that continues until funds are found.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Scanner is implemented as an expandable/collapsible card component instead of a modal
2. ✅ Scanner card is positioned prominently on the main dashboard
3. ✅ Auto-navigation modes: Random Page, Forward Sequential, Backward Sequential
4. ✅ Scanner automatically navigates to next page after balance check completion
5. ✅ Scanner stops and highlights when any balance > 0 is detected
6. ✅ Scanner provides real-time feedback on current scanning progress
7. ✅ Scanner can be started/stopped at any time while preserving current page context
8. ✅ Scanner integrates with existing balance checking system
9. ✅ Scanner maintains session state during scanning operations
10. ✅ Scanner shows scanning statistics (pages scanned, time elapsed, current rate)

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Summary
**Component Created:** `ScannerCard.tsx` - New expandable card component
**Integration:** Replaced `ScannerModal` usage in main page
**Store Integration:** Enhanced use of existing `scannerStore`

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Expandable Card Interface
- Material-UI `Accordion` for expand/collapse functionality
- Card styling with enhanced borders when scanning
- Compact header showing status and quick controls
- Detailed expanded view with full configuration

#### 2. Auto-Navigation Modes
- **Random Mode**: Cryptographically secure random page generation using `crypto.getRandomValues()`
- **Forward Mode**: Sequential navigation with boundary wrapping
- **Backward Mode**: Reverse sequential navigation with boundary wrapping
- **Decimal.js Integration**: Proper handling of very large page numbers

#### 3. Intelligent Balance Detection
- Real-time API calls to check each page for balances
- Automatic scanning stops when any balance > 0 detected
- Balance calculation across all addresses on the page
- Success highlighting with found balance information

#### 4. Real-Time Statistics
- **Pages Scanned**: Live counter of processed pages
- **Time Elapsed**: Formatted duration display (MM:SS)
- **Scan Rate**: Pages per minute calculation
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress indicator
- **Current Status**: Live display of current page and mode

#### 5. Enhanced UX Features
- **Visual States**: Different styling for scanning vs idle states
- **Quick Controls**: Start/stop buttons in header for immediate access
- **Configuration**: Adjustable scan delay and maximum pages
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains current page when scanner starts

### Technical Architecture

#### Component Structure
```
ScannerCard
├── Accordion (expand/collapse)
│   ├── AccordionSummary (status header)
│   │   ├── Scanner icon and title
│   │   ├── Real-time statistics chips
│   │   └── Start/stop controls
│   └── AccordionDetails (configuration panel)
│       ├── Navigation mode selection
│       ├── Scan configuration
│       ├── Current scanning status
│       ├── Found balance alerts
│       └── Session statistics
```

#### Navigation Logic
```typescript
generateNextPage(): string {
  switch (autoNavigationMode) {
    case 'forward': return currentPage + 1 (with wrapping)
    case 'backward': return currentPage - 1 (with wrapping)  
    case 'random': return crypto-secure random page
  }
}
```

#### Balance Detection Flow
```
1. Generate next page → 2. Call API → 3. Check balances
                                          ↓
4. Stop if found ← 5. Continue if none ← 6. Update statistics
```

### Integration Points
**Main Page Integration:**
- Positioned after Advanced Navigation, before Balance Status
- Uses existing `handleDirectPageChange` for page navigation
- Integrates with current page state management

**API Integration:**
- Uses `/api/generate-page` endpoint for page data
- Processes balance information from all address types
- Handles errors gracefully with automatic scanner stop

**Store Integration:**
- Uses existing `scannerStore` for state persistence
- Enhances store with scanner statistics
- Maintains compatibility with existing scanner functionality

### UI/UX Enhancements
**Material-UI Components Used:**
- `Accordion` for expandable interface
- `ToggleButtonGroup` for navigation mode selection
- `LinearProgress` for scanning progress
- `Chip` components for real-time statistics
- `Alert` for found balance notifications
- `Grid` layout for responsive statistics display

**Visual Design:**
- Enhanced borders and shadows when scanning
- Color-coded status indicators (primary for active, error for stop)
- Icon integration for intuitive navigation mode selection
- Responsive layout adapting to screen size

### Performance Considerations
- **Configurable Delays**: Prevents API overload with adjustable scan delays
- **Maximum Page Limits**: Automatic stop prevention for runaway scans
- **Efficient State Updates**: Optimized React state management
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of intervals and timeouts
