# Story 1.7: Critical Functionality Fixes and Enhanced Navigation

## Status
**COMPLETED** âœ…

## Story
**As a** user of the Bitcoin Keyspace Explorer,
**I want** all navigation features to work properly with real Bitcoin addresses and enhanced controls,
**so that** I can efficiently explore the keyspace with accurate data and intuitive navigation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Quick jump navigation triggers page generation automatically with proper validation
2. Real Bitcoin address generation using proper cryptographic libraries
3. Keys per page changes update results immediately and recalculate pagination
4. Keyspace slider shows current position and allows direct navigation
5. Scanner functionality works with real balance checking
6. Navigation controls are properly positioned without overlapping
7. Extended keys per page options up to 10,000 for performance testing
8. All features are thoroughly tested and validated

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 1.6, we learned:
- BigInt serialization issues were resolved but need monitoring
- Floating navigation was implemented but has layout issues
- Navigation store was created but needs integration with page generation
- Bitcoin address generation needs proper cryptographic implementation

### Data Models
- Navigation state with dynamic page calculation
- Page generation with configurable keys per page
- Bitcoin address generation with proper cryptographic validation
- Scanner state with progress tracking
- Keyspace slider with percentage calculation

### API Specifications
- Page generation API with keysPerPage parameter
- Real Bitcoin address generation API
- Balance checking API with multiple sources
- Scanner API with progress tracking

### Component Specifications
- KeyspaceSlider component with drag functionality
- Updated AdvancedNavigation with automatic page generation
- Fixed FloatingNavigation with static positioning
- Scanner component with real functionality
- Enhanced page generation with configurable limits

### File Locations
- `src/app/components/KeyspaceSlider.tsx` - New keyspace slider component
- `src/app/components/AdvancedNavigation.tsx` - Update with auto-generation
- `src/app/components/FloatingNavigation.tsx` - Fix layout positioning
- `src/app/components/Scanner.tsx` - New scanner component
- `src/app/api/generate-page/route.ts` - Add keysPerPage parameter
- `src/lib/services/KeyGenerationService.ts` - Real Bitcoin address generation
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Update with new components and functionality

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for navigation components
- Integration tests for Bitcoin address generation
- Performance tests for large datasets
- Scanner functionality tests
- UI/UX testing for navigation flow

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing performance optimizations
- Real Bitcoin address generation must be cryptographically correct
- Navigation must handle large key spaces efficiently
- Scanner must work with real APIs
- UI must be responsive and accessible
