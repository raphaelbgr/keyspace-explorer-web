## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Story 1.25 completion notes, the system now has real cryptocurrency address generation implemented with proper libraries (bchaddrjs, ripple-address-codec, bs58check). The multi-currency architecture is fully established with proper service layers.

### Data Models and Interfaces
[Source: architecture.md#Data Models]

Current system uses these interfaces that need extension:
```typescript
interface PrivateKey {
  privateKey: string;
  pageNumber: bigint;
  index: number;
  addresses: DerivedAddresses;
  balances: AddressBalances;
  totalBalance: number;
}
```

New interfaces needed:
```typescript
interface CryptoPriceData {
  currency: string;
  usdPrice: number;
  change24h: number;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

interface PriceCache {
  [currency: string]: CryptoPriceData;
}

interface USDBalanceData {
  cryptoBalance: number;
  usdValue: number;
  currency: string;
}
```

### Current Component Architecture
[Source: File system analysis]

Key components that need modification:
- `PortfolioAnalytics.tsx` (16KB, 475 lines) - Replace with CryptoPriceDashboard
- `AddressManagement.tsx` (11KB, 401 lines) - Add USD value display and fix copy errors
- `UltraOptimizedDashboard.tsx` (23KB, 589 lines) - Integrate USD calculations
- `AddressModal.tsx` (21KB, 592 lines) - Fix copy button error at line 146

### API Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#REST API Specification]

New API endpoints needed:
```yaml
/api/crypto-prices:
  get:
    summary: Fetch current cryptocurrency prices
    responses:
      200:
        description: Current USD prices for all supported currencies
        
/api/usd-values:
  post:
    summary: Calculate USD values for given crypto balances
    requestBody:
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              balances:
                type: object
                additionalProperties:
                  type: number
```

### Service Layer Architecture
[Source: apps/web/src/lib/services/]

Existing services to leverage:
- `MultiCurrencyBalanceService.ts` (26KB, 797 lines) - Extend for USD calculations
- `EnhancedMultiCurrencyService.ts` (12KB, 364 lines) - Integration point for price data

New services to create:
- `CryptoPriceService.ts` - Price fetching and caching
- `USDCalculationService.ts` - Crypto-to-USD conversion utilities
- `TokenFormatterService.ts` - Centralized formatting logic

### Database Schema Extensions
[Source: architecture.md#Database Schema]

New tables needed:
```sql
CREATE TABLE crypto_prices (
    currency VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    usd_price DECIMAL(20,8) NOT NULL,
    change_24h DECIMAL(8,4),
    last_updated TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_crypto_prices_updated ON crypto_prices(last_updated);
```

### Token Precision Standards
Currency precision requirements:
- BTC: 8 decimal places (0.00000000)
- ETH: 18 decimal places with smart truncation (show 6-8 significant digits)
- BCH: 8 decimal places (same as BTC)
- LTC: 8 decimal places
- DASH: 8 decimal places  
- DOGE: 8 decimal places
- XRP: 6 decimal places
- ZEC: 8 decimal places

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Atomic Units Handling
**All balances in the application are stored in their smallest atomic units:**
- BTC: satoshis (1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis)
- ETH: wei (1 ETH = 10^18 wei)
- BCH: satoshis (1 BCH = 100,000,000 satoshis)
- XRP: drops (1 XRP = 1,000,000 drops)
- LTC: litoshis (1 LTC = 100,000,000 litoshis)
- DASH: duffs (1 DASH = 100,000,000 duffs)
- DOGE: koinus (1 DOGE = 100,000,000 koinus)
- ZEC: zatoshi (1 ZEC = 100,000,000 zatoshi)

**Example:** A balance of `14203245` represents:
- BTC: 0.14203245 BTC (14,203,245 satoshis)
- ETH: 0.000000000014203245 ETH (14,203,245 wei)
- XRP: 14.203245 XRP (14,203,245 drops)

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: AddressModal.tsx error analysis]

The copy button error occurs at line 146 due to:
```typescript
// Problematic code pattern:
navigator.clipboard.writeText(privateKey)
```

Required fix pattern:
```typescript
// Safe implementation:
if (navigator.clipboard && navigator.clipboard.writeText) {
  try {
    await navigator.clipboard.writeText(privateKey);
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to legacy method
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack - Testing]

Testing frameworks to use:
- **Frontend Testing:** Jest + React Testing Library for component tests
- **Backend Testing:** Jest + Supertest for API endpoint tests
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright for full workflow testing

Test file locations:
- Component tests: `src/__tests__/components/`
- Service tests: `src/__tests__/services/`
- API tests: `src/__tests__/api/`

Specific testing requirements:
- Unit tests for all price fetching and caching logic
- Integration tests for USD calculation accuracy
- Component tests for proper formatting display
- Error handling tests for clipboard operations
- Performance tests for price update mechanisms
