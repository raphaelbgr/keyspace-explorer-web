# Story 1.22: Multi-Currency Wallet Display and Balance Visualization

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** user exploring multi-currency keyspace results,
**I want** to see organized displays of all token wallets and their balances with clear visual indicators,
**so that** I can quickly identify funded addresses across all supported cryptocurrencies and understand the distribution of funds.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Display all 8 cryptocurrency wallets in organized sections with currency icons
2. Show balance information for each currency with appropriate formatting and precision
3. Implement visual fund indicators (funded/empty) across all currencies
4. Create expandable currency sections for detailed address viewing
5. Add total portfolio value calculation and display across all currencies
6. Implement currency-specific balance highlighting and visual cues
7. Support both grid and table view modes for multi-currency display
8. Add copy functionality and blockchain explorer links for all addresses
9. Show funding distribution charts and statistics across currencies
10. Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing Bitcoin wallet display functionality must remain unchanged
- IV2: Performance must remain acceptable with 8x wallet data display
- IV3: All existing UI themes and accessibility features must be preserved

## Dev Notes

### Multi-Currency Wallet Display Component
```typescript
interface MultiCurrencyWalletProps {
  privateKey: string;
  addresses: CurrencyAddressMap;
  balances: MultiCurrencyBalances;
  isExpanded?: boolean;
  viewMode: 'grid' | 'table';
  onAddressCopy: (address: string, currency: CryptoCurrency) => void;
  onExplorerLink: (address: string, currency: CryptoCurrency) => void;
}

interface CurrencySection {
  currency: CryptoCurrency;
  icon: string;
  name: string;
  addresses: AddressTypeMap;
  totalBalance: string;
  fundedAddresses: number;
  isExpanded: boolean;
}
```

### Currency-Specific Display Configuration
```typescript
const CURRENCY_DISPLAY_CONFIG = {
  BTC: {
    icon: '₿',
    name: 'Bitcoin',
    precision: 8,
    symbol: 'BTC',
    explorer: 'https://blockstream.info/address/',
    color: '#f7931a'
  },
  ETH: {
    icon: 'Ξ',
    name: 'Ethereum', 
    precision: 18,
    symbol: 'ETH',
    explorer: 'https://etherscan.io/address/',
    color: '#627eea'
  },
  // ... other currencies
};
```

### Portfolio Analytics Interface
```typescript
interface PortfolioAnalytics {
  totalValue: {
    [currency in CryptoCurrency]: string;
  };
  fundingDistribution: {
    currency: CryptoCurrency;
    percentage: number;
    addressCount: number;
    totalBalance: string;
  }[];
  diversityScore: number;
  topFundedCurrency: CryptoCurrency;
  emptyWallets: CryptoCurrency[];
}
```

### Visual Design Patterns
- **Funded Indicators**: Green checkmarks, bold balances, highlighted cards
- **Empty Indicators**: Gray icons, muted text, collapsed sections
- **Currency Icons**: Standardized size (24px), consistent positioning
- **Balance Formatting**: Right-aligned, monospace font, appropriate precision
- **Expansion States**: Smooth animations, clear visual hierarchy

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Rendering**: Only render visible currency sections
- **State Optimization**: Memoize expensive calculations
- **Bundle Splitting**: Load currency-specific components on demand
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large datasets with many private keys
- **Image Optimization**: Efficient currency icon loading

### Responsive Design Breakpoints
- **Mobile (≤768px)**: Stacked currency cards, simplified table view
- **Tablet (769px-1024px)**: 2-column grid, condensed table columns
- **Desktop (≥1025px)**: Full multi-column layout, expanded table view

### Accessibility Features
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels for all currency sections
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order through currency sections and addresses
- **High Contrast**: Support for high contrast themes
- **Font Scaling**: Proper scaling with browser font size changes
