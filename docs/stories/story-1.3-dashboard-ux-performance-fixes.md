# Story 1.3: Dashboard UX/UI Performance Fixes

## Epic: Dashboard Enhancement
**Story ID:** STORY-1.3  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Status:** In Development  

## User Story
As a user of the Bitcoin Keyspace Explorer, I want a responsive, fast, and properly functioning dashboard with persistent settings and optimal performance so that I can efficiently explore Bitcoin keys without frustration.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Theme Persistence & Consistency
- [x] Dark/Light mode persists after page refresh
- [x] All UI elements start in correct theme mode (no mixed states)
- [x] Theme toggle works consistently across all components
- [x] No flash of incorrect theme on page load

### 2. Display Mode & Pagination
- [x] Default display mode is List (not Grid)
- [x] Show 45 items per page (not 10)
- [x] Add navigation buttons: First, Previous, Next, Last
- [x] Navigation buttons positioned near page number input
- [x] Current page indicator clearly visible

### 3. Language Support
- [ ] Add language selector with flag icons (Brazil for Portuguese, US for English)
- [ ] Language preference persists after refresh
- [ ] All UI text supports both languages
- [ ] Flag icons are properly sized and positioned

### 4. List Mode Enhancements
- [ ] Private keys display in full hex format
- [ ] Column header shows "Private Key (hex)"
- [ ] Start with private key hex equivalent of 00000000001
- [ ] Expandable rows show all generated wallet addresses
- [ ] Wallet addresses displayed in table format with balances
- [ ] Balance responses shown in BTC on the right side
- [ ] Increased row height to accommodate all wallet data

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Reduce Interaction to Next Paint (INP) from 520ms to <100ms
- [ ] Optimize button interactions (currently 520ms, 416ms, 360ms)
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- [ ] Lazy load components and data
- [ ] Optimize Material-UI component rendering
- [ ] Reduce bundle size and improve loading times

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Performance
- Implement React.memo for expensive components
- Use useCallback and useMemo for performance optimization
- Implement virtual scrolling with react-window or similar
- Optimize Material-UI theme configuration
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders

### State Management
- Implement proper theme persistence with localStorage
- Add language state management
- Optimize Zustand store for performance
- Implement proper loading states

### UI/UX Improvements
- Fix theme initialization to prevent flash
- Implement proper loading indicators
- Add smooth transitions and animations
- Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Performance metrics improved (INP < 100ms)
- [ ] Theme and language preferences persist correctly
- [ ] List mode displays all required information
- [ ] Navigation works smoothly
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Dependencies
- Story 1.2 (Dashboard UX/UI Improvements)
- Material-UI optimization knowledge
- Performance profiling tools

## Estimation
- **Development:** 3-4 days
- **Testing:** 1 day
- **Total:** 4-5 days

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Performance optimization may require significant refactoring
- **Medium Risk:** Language implementation complexity
- **Low Risk:** Theme persistence fixes

## Notes
- Focus on performance first as it affects user experience significantly
- Consider implementing React.lazy for code splitting
- Test with large datasets to ensure scalability
- Monitor bundle size and loading times

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- Full Stack Developer (James)

### Debug Log References
- Task 1.1: Fixed theme persistence with proper SSR handling and hydration
- Task 1.2: Changed default display mode from 'grid' to 'table'
- Task 1.3: Updated items per page from 10 to 45
- Task 1.4: Replaced Material-UI Pagination with custom navigation buttons

### Completion Notes List
- ✅ Theme persistence now works correctly with localStorage and proper hydration
- ✅ No more flash of incorrect theme on page load
- ✅ Default display mode is now List (table) instead of Grid
- ✅ Pagination shows 45 items per page instead of 10
- ✅ Custom navigation buttons (First, Previous, Next, Last) with proper disabled states
- ✅ Current page indicator shows "Page X of Y" format
- ✅ All buttons have tooltips for better UX
- ✅ Performance optimizations implemented with React.memo for KeyCard and KeyTableRow components
- ✅ useMemo for expensive calculations (displayedKeys, totalPages)
- ✅ useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Component splitting with ControlPanel, KeyCard, and KeyTableRow
- ✅ Reduced bundle size and improved rendering performance
- ✅ Fixed Material-UI Slide animation errors by removing problematic animations
- ✅ Fixed KeyIcon reference error by removing unused icon from Chip component
- ✅ Added aggressive performance optimizations: debounce, throttle, 60fps limiting
- ✅ Implemented useDebounce and useThrottle hooks for better INP
- ✅ Added performance.now() checks to prevent excessive re-renders
