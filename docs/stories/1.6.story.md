# Story 1.6: Floating Navigation Layout Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user of the Bitcoin Keyspace Explorer,
**I want** a floating navigation layout with properly positioned controls,
**so that** I can easily access all features without UI conflicts and have a better user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dark mode toggle and language selector are properly positioned without overlap
2. Navigation controls are grouped logically in a floating layout
3. Layout is responsive and works on different screen sizes
4. All existing functionality remains accessible
5. Performance is maintained or improved
6. Real Bitcoin address generation is implemented
7. Navigation auto-generation and dynamic page calculation work correctly
8. All features are thoroughly tested

  - [x] Test performance metrics
  - [x] Test real Bitcoin address generation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 1.3 and 1.4, we learned:
- BigInt serialization issues in API responses need to be handled
- Performance optimizations are critical for large datasets
- Real Bitcoin address generation requires bitcoinjs-lib integration
- UI layout conflicts can impact user experience

### Data Models
- Navigation state management using Zustand
- Theme persistence with localStorage
- Language preferences with localStorage
- Key generation with BigInt support

### API Specifications
- Key generation API with BigInt serialization handling
- Balance checking API with multiple sources
- Random page generation API

### Component Specifications
- FloatingNavigation component with grouped controls
- Dark mode toggle with proper positioning
- Language selector with flag icons
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Performance-optimized rendering

### File Locations
- `src/components/FloatingNavigation.tsx` - New floating navigation component
- `src/stores/navigationStore.ts` - Navigation state management
- `src/services/KeyGenerationService.ts` - Update for real Bitcoin addresses
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Update main page layout
- `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` - Update positioning
- `src/components/LanguageSelector.tsx` - Update positioning

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for navigation components
- Integration tests for Bitcoin address generation
- Performance tests for large datasets
- Responsive design testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing performance optimizations
- BigInt serialization must be handled properly
- Responsive design must work on all screen sizes
- Real Bitcoin address generation must be accurate
- Navigation must handle large key spaces efficiently
